Gutenberg Modifications
===
main.css will be used to template the 3 Gutenberg Projects.

An index.html has been made to navigate between the Gutenberg Projects. An extra
file was made (Alice in Wonderland) where the website was reskinned. This had
some extensive HTML changes (additions of DIV tags, reclassing tags, addition of
a Nav Bar, etc) and does not follow assignment specs (it is an extra). This uses style.css as it;s own css file.

The assignment specs have been applied to Frankenstien, Photography, and Metamorphsis, as following the guide lines specified in the fourms at this reference (https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=460544)

1. For the content links, all links were chopped to #chapter##. This allows
us to go to the chapter without going to the official page resource in
the main Project Gutenberg site. 

2. In Frankenstien.html and Photograph.html they have their own built in css style
section. The conflicted styling has been moved to main.css to ensure all gutenberg pages have a consistent look.

3. Line 58 in Metamorphsis has a new class added to the header to change the color of the text.
